#### Dataset:Acted Emotional Speech Dynamic Database â€“ AESDD

A Public Speech Emotion Recognition Dataset Databases of emotional speech are divided into two main categories, the ones that contain utterances of acted emotional speech and the ones that contain spontaneous emotional speech. Both categories have benefits and limitations.

The Acted Emotional Speech Dynamic Database (AESDD) is a publically available speech emotion recognition dataset. It contains utterances of acted emotional speech in the Greek language.

The motive for the creation of the database was the absence of a publically available high-quality database for SER in Greek, a realization made during the research on an emotion-triggered lighting framework for theatrical performance. The database utterances with five emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness.
